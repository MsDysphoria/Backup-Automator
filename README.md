## Information
`What is it?` <br />
- Backup Automator is a software that enables you to back up specified folders and files automatically and regularly at set time intervals. Additionally, it offers a feature to highly compress the backup files.
 
`Where can I use it?` <br />
- Originally intended as an alternative and custom auto-save to back up progress for games that were lacking in that, it can also prove to be useful in many instances where one would need to regularly back up folders and files subjected to frequent changes on a schedule such as file based databases and records, any data concerning hosted websites and such." 

`How can I use it?` <br />
- Pick the target directory or files to back up and a directory where the backup files will be saved. Set the name for backup (date and timestamp get added automatically), set the desired interval in minutes (i.e. 15 for every quarter an hour), check &quot;Compression&quot; to compress files if needed and begin the process

To install and use this software, simply extract the archive found in `Releases`.
